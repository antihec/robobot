phrases and randomized substitutions.

=head2 fake-quote

=head3 Description

Generates a fake quote either by the personality specified, otherwise by one
chosen at random.

=head3 Usage

[<personality> [<pattern>]]

=head3 Examples

    (fake-quote)
    (fake-quote joe)

=head2 add-fake-personality

=head3 Description

Adds a new fake personality with the given name.

New personalities have no phrases and will generate no quotes until at least
one has been added with ``(add-fake-quote)``.

=head3 Usage

<personality name>

=head3 Examples

    (add-fake-personality joe)

=head2 add-fake-quote

=head3 Description

Adds a fake quote phrase to the given personality, optionally including
placeholders to use for randomized substitutions.

Placeholders take the form of an identifier inside curly braces, such as
``{verb}``. Any time a fake quote is being generated, placeholders are looked
for and replaced with a random term of the type specified. There are no forced
restrictions on the names for placeholders, other than they cannot contain
curly braces.

=head3 Usage

<personality name> <phrase>

=head3 Examples

    (add-fake-quote joe "I like {food}!")

=head2 add-fake-substitution

=head3 Description

Adds a term to the list of possible substitutions when generating phrases for
the name  personality.

The ``type`` should match the string used when including placeholders in
``(add-fake-quote)`` phrases. Multiple terms may be specified, as long as they
are all for the same ``type``.

=head3 Usage

<personality name> <type> <term> [<term> ...]

=head3 Examples

    (add-fake-substitution joe food "pizza" "ice cream cones" "hard gravel")
