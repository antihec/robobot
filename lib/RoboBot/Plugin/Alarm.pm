=head1 alarm

Exports functions for setting and modifying alarms, which can trigger messages
at specified times or intervals.

In addition to the exported functions, this module maintains a collection of
persistent AnyEvent timer objects which are used to fire the alarm messages
asynchronously from any regular message processing.

=head2 set-alarm

=head3 Description

Creates a new alarm in the current channel. The only required parameters are an
alarm name and its first occurrence. An optional message may be included, which
will be echoed whenever the alarm fires. Its length and formatting are limited
only by the features of the network on which the alarm was set (e.g. IRC will
generally be a couple hundred characters or less of plain text, whereas Slack
would allow several KB of text with formatting).

The initial date and time of the alarm, specified with ``:first`` must be a
valid ISO8601 formatted timestamp. The timezone is optional and will default to
that of the server on which the bot is running if omitted. It must also be a
date and time in the future.

Alarms may be set to recur by specifying an interval with ``:recurring``. The
format of the interval (shockingly!) matches that of the interval type in
PostgreSQL. Before the alarm is created, a test is performed to ensure that the
alarm will not fire too often, as a small measure to prevent abuse. The alarm
creation will be rejected if it will emit messages more than a few times an
hour.

An exclusion pattern may also be specified with ``:exclude``. Any timestamps
from the recurrence interval that match the exclusion patterns will be skipped.
The format of the is a comma-separated list of ``<field>=<regular expression>``
and may use any of the PostgreSQL ``to_char(...)`` formatting fields.

=head3 Usage

<alarm name> :first <ISO8601> [:recurring <interval>] [:exclude <pattern>] [<message>]

=head3 Examples

    (set-alarm daily-standup
      :first     "2016-04-25 10:00:00 US/Eastern"
      :recurring "1 day"
      :exclude   "Day=(Saturday|Sunday)"
      "Daily Standup time! Meet in the large conference room.")

=head2 delete-alarm

=head3 Description

Permanently removes the named alarm from the current channel. The alarm must be
recreated from scratch if you wish to use it again.

=head3 Usage

<alarm name>

=head3 Examples

    (delete-alarm daily-standup)

=head2 show-alarm

=head3 Description

Displays the named alarm and its current settings.

=head3 Usage

<alarm name>

=head3 Examples

    (show-alarm daily-standup)

=head2 list-alarms

=head3 Description

Displays all of the alarms for the current channel, as well as their current
state (active or suspended) and their next triggering time. If the alarms are
recurring that is noted with the recurrence interval.

=head2 suspend-alarm

=head3 Description

Temporarily suspends the named alarm.

=head3 Usage

<alarm name>

=head3 Examples

    (suspend-alarm daily-standup)

=head2 resume-alarm

=head3 Description

Resumes a suspended alarm. Does nothing to alarms which are not currently
suspended. A non-recurring alarm which had been suspended during the time at
which it should have triggered is effectively deleted by resuming it. Recurring
alarms will simply skip past any triggering intervals which passed during their
suspension.

=head3 Usage

<alarm name>

=head3 Examples

    (resume-alarm daily-standup)
