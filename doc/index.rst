RoboBot
=======

Welcome to |RB|, the extensible multi-protocol bot that communicates with a
pronounced lisp.

In the following pages you will find the software's operation, design, and
rough edges discussed in (hopefully thorough) detail. This guide is broken down
into the following top-level sections:

:ref:`ch-intro`
    Overview of the bot, its most notable features, basic interactions, and how
    to help contribute to the project (or receive help).

:ref:`ch-config`
    Detailed setup and configuration instructions for those wishing to operate
    an instance of the bot.

:ref:`ch-lang`
    Coverage of all |RB|'s syntax and other core language features.

:ref:`ch-modules`
    Listing and documentation for all bundled modules, which form the meat of
    the bot's functionality out of the box (before users start macroing their
    own features).

If you run into any problems, or wish to contribute to the software, please
don't hesitate to check out the project `on GitHub <https://github.com/jsime/robobot>`_.
