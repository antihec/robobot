=head1 channellink

Allows for echoing messages across different channels, even across networks.

Linked channels require the bot to exist in both. Messages sent by users of one
channel will be echoed to the other by the bot. When possible (network features
permitting), the names of the original senders will be included in the echoed
output.

The linked channels do not need to be on the same network, but they must be
connected to by the same instance of the bot.

=head2 link-channels

=head3 Description

Links the current channel with the named channel, so that all messages
appearing in one are echoed to the other.

The link needs to be created only in one of the channels, as all links are
bi-directional. Echoed messages will be sent by the bot, but will be prefaced
with the string "<$network/$nick>" to indicate the original speaker and their
location. The channel name will assume a leading ``#`` in the event you do not
provide one (you cannot link one channel with a direct message).

For a list of networks and channels, refer to ``(network-list)`` and
``(channel-list)``, respectively.

=head3 Usage

<network> <channel>

=head3 Examples

    (link-channels freenode #mysecrethideout)

=head2 unlink-channels

=head3 Description

Removes the link with the named channel. As all links are bi-directional, this
function needs to be called only from one side to tear down the full link.

=head3 Usage

<network> <channel>

=head3 Examples

    (unlink-channels freenode #mysecrethideout)

=head2 channel-links

=head3 Description

Displays the current list of channels to which the current channel is linked.
