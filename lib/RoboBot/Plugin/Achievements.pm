=head1 achievements

Exports functions for creating and viewing chat achievements, which are much
like the ridiculous fake-internet-point badges from video games.

Each achievement has a name, a description, and a SQL query which is run to
determine whether a specific user has met the requirements to earn the badge.

In addition to the xported functions, the module inserts a post-hook into the
message processing pipeline of RoboBot which retrieves the list of achievements
not yet earned by the user whose message was just processed, executes each
achievement's associated SQL query, and if the query returns a true value in
the first column of the first row the hook then awards the achievement to the
user and notifies them with a congratulatory message. For this reason, the
queries used to determine achievement eligibility must execute quickly.

=head2 add-achievement

=head3 Description

Creates a new achievement. Achievements must have a name, a description, and a
SQL query which is used to determine a person's eligibility. The query must
return a true value in the first column of the first row to indicate that the
user may earn the achievement. Anything else will consider the user ineligible
at that time.

Achievements are currently earned only a single time. There is no support for
recurring achievements (tiers/levels which increment).

Because the SQL query is executed every time a message is processed from a user
who has not yet earned the achievement, they must be written for speed. The SQL
query will receive a single bind variable: the ``nick_id`` of the user whose
message was just processed.

=head3 Usage

<name> <description> <query>

=head3 Examples

    (add-achievement
      Chatterbox
      "You love the sound of your own keyboard. You've sent 10,000 messages!"
      "select count(*) >= 10000 from logger_log where nick_id = ?")

=head2 show-achievement

=head3 Description

Displays the details of the named achievement, along with a list of the people
