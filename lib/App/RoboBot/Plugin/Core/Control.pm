=head1 core.control

Exports a selection of control structure functions and special forms.

Most of these functions and forms operate on the principle of "truthiness"
which may not be self-evident to users of languages that have strict concepts
of ``True`` and ``False`` (and sometimes nil/null/etc.). App::RoboBot follows the
somewhat more expansive concept of truthiness that the Perl language uses, in
which anything that isn't a negative number, the literal number ``0``,
undefined, an empty string, or a string of nothing but a single zero character
is considered to be true. Thus, an empty Map would be true; a String containing
two or more zeroes but nothing else would be true; even the String ``"false"``
would be true.  But a comparison operator that returns the numeric ``0``, or a
string with a single zero character, or a ``nil`` would be false.

=head2 do

=head3 Description

Evaluates the provided list of expressions, one by one, in the order given. All
expression side effects will occur in the specified order, though only the
value of the final expression will be returned by ``do`` itself.

=head3 Usage

<list of expressions>

=head3 Examples

    :emphasize-lines: 2-4

    (do (print "line1") (+ 1 1) (print "line2") (* 4 4))
    "line1"
    "line2"
    16

=head2 if

=head3 Description

Evaluates the given condition, which if truthy leads to the evaluation of the
``<true expression>``. If the condition did not yield a truthy value and a
third operand is present, that is evaluated instead.

Neither of the true or false expressions need to be quoted to prevent their
initial evaluation, as this is a special form. Only one of the expressions will
ever be evaluated on any invocation of the ``if`` form.

=head3 Usage

<condition> <true expression> [<false expression>]

=head3 Examples

    :emphasize-lines: 2

    (if (< 1 2) "One is less than two." "This will never evaluate.")
    "One is less than two."

=head2 while

=head3 Description

Evaluates the given condition repeatedly, evaluating the expression each time
that the condition is true. Completes only when the condition eventualy returns
a false value (or the internal loop limit is reached).

Note that is the condition has side-effects, they will occur on every single
iteration until the ``while`` itself terminates.

=head3 Usage

<condition> <expression>

=head3 Examples

    (while (< 5 (random 10)) (print "Rolled over 5."))

=head2 cond

=head3 Description

Similar to ``if``, this form evaluates a condition and if it yields a truthy
value, evluates the expression immediately following the condition. Unlike
``if``, this form accepts an arbitrary number of condition-expression pairs.
The first pair whose condition is true will have its expression evaluated and
the ``cond`` form will terminate without any further evaluations.

If none of the conditions from the pairs yields a truthy value, and there are
an odd number of operands provided, the last one will be used as a default
expression to evaluate and its value will be returned by ``cond`` instead.

The return value of the ``cond`` is that of the single expression which was
evaluated.

=head3 Usage

<condition> <expression> [<condition> <expression> ...] [<fallback>]

=head3 Examples

    :emphasize-lines: 4,9,14

    (cond
      (== 1 2) "No way this gets evaluated."
      (> 10 5) "Ten is a bigger number than five.")
    "Ten is a bigger number than five."

    (cond
      (eq "foo" "bar") "Inequal strings. This won't happen."
      (print "Fallback expression being evaluated."))
    "Fallback expression being evaluated."

    (cond
      (!= 1 2) "These are indeed different numbers!"
      (!= 3 4) "We never get this far, because the first condition was true.")
    "These are indeed different numbers!"

=head2 apply

=head3 Description

Repeatedly applies the function to each element of the list, in the order
provided by the list, returning a new list of the results.

=head3 Usage

<function> <list>

=head3 Examples

    :emphasize-lines: 2

    (apply + (seq 1 5))
    (2 3 4 5 6)

=head2 repeat

=head3 Description

Repeats the evaluation of the given list/expression ``count`` times, returning
a list of all the results.

=head3 Usage

<count> <list|expression>

=head3 Examples

    (repeat 3 (upper "foo"))
