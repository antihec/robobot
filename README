RoboBot

RoboBot is a pluggable, POE based IRC bot. It can connect simultaneously
to multiple servers and multiple channels, responds to direct messages
or channel messages, and includes features like command piping and output
redirection.

While not intended, by any stretch of the imagination, to be the be-all
end-all of IRC bots, the hope is that RoboBot provides a fairly simple
and straightforward way to offer flexible commands and message
processing for your IRC needs.
